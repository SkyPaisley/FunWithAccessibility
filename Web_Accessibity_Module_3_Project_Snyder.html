<h1>New Adventures: Introducing My Kids to Skiing </h1>
<h2>My Story: Learning How to Ski</h2>
<p>I still remember when my family and I went to <a href="https://www.canaanresort.com/ski-winter-activities" target="_blank">Cannon Valley</a> in West Virginia on our first skiing trip. The snow was slush and there was the occasional puddle that reminded you we <em>weren't</em> in the Rocky Mountains. I had the best time that weekend learning how to ski, even if the conditions weren't the best.</p> 

<p>Later on, I had the opportunity to explore skiing in New England when we moved to the Boston area when I was in middle school. My sister and I explored Vermont and New Hampshire on family trips, and we improved our skills through weekly lessons at <a href="https://www.skinashoba.com" target="_blank">Nashoba Valley</a> in Westford, Massachusetts. While Nashoba Valley isn't a destination ski resort, we felt lucky to have a skiing hill 20 minutes from our house where we could practice and have fun with friends.</p> 
<h2>Family Life: Skiing With My Boys</h2>

<p>I took a break from skiing for several years when life got busy<sub>1</sub>, but once my kids reached the ages of 6 and 8, my husband and I decided we wanted to introduce them to the sport.</p>

<p>Now we're in our third year of skiing as a family and recently enjoyed a beautiful family trip to <a href="https://www.parkcitymountain.com/" target="_blank">Park City Mountain</a> this past February. We enjoyed skiing on more challenging terrain, including some of the most fun glades I've ever experienced. When you're at the top of a mountain in the Rockies, you can't help but smile and realize just how lucky you are to experience the outdoors like this.</p>

<h2>Lessons Learned: Tips Worth Sharing</h2>

<p>Many people have asked me for tips for skiing with my family. While I'm not an expert, I have learned a few things over the last few years and am happy to share them with others to make their ski experience with kids just a little bit easier.<p/>

<p><strong>Define Your Goals</strong>. Our goal for our first ski vacation was to introduce the kids to skiing so that they would want to do it again the following year. We enrolled them in ski school so they could develop the basics and give my husband and me a break to ski ourselves for the morning. Once our kids mastered the basics, we gave them new challenges to master, like making at least three turns down the bunny slope before using the pizza method for slowing down.</p> 
<p><strong>Get the Gear</strong>. Ski gear is expensive, but it's also important to be prepared! For our first trip, we rented our skis and helmets and made sure the kids had warm, waterproof jackets and ski pants. Hand and feet warmers, a cozy neck gaiter, and ski socks that are warm that aren't too thick and bulky are much needed. Waterproof gloves or mittens are key. Pro tip: Buy an extra pair in case they get wet or lost. Long underwear is perfect as a base layer so kids stay warm.

Here are a few of my favorite brands for good quality ski gear:

<ul style="list-style-type:disc;">
  <li>The North Face</li>
  <li>L.L. Bean</li>
  <li>REI</li>
  <li>Patagonia</li>
</ul>

</p>
<p><strong>Stay Local</strong>. We live in Northern Virginia, where there are a few ski resorts within a few hours drive. When you're introducing young kids to skiing, it's much easier to simply drive a few hours away to your destination than take a long road trip or plane ride to a larger resort. The smaller resorts have a lot of perks, too. They're often easier to navigate, cost less, and cater to the needs of beginners.</p> 

<p>Here's a reference for the local ski resorts if you live in the DC metro area:</p>

</p>



<p><strong>Provide Alternatives</strong>. When we did our first ski trip, we also wanted to have some non-skiing activities in mind in case skiing was a total bust. For us, that meant that we reserved an overpriced timeslot to go tubing for a few hours at Wisp resort. Everyone had a great time and it was a nice break from learning how to ski. Depending on your location, you could consider a variety of activities: ice skating, an arcade, bowling, or even going to a movie theater.</p> 
<p><strong>Stick to a Budget</strong> Skiing can be expensive. Last year at Park City, the same-day price for a lift ticket was $350 a person during a peak time in February. Yikes! The good news is that there are ways to ski on a budget. </p>

<ol>
  <strong><li>Lift Tickets</li></strong> Almost every resort gives you a discount for purchasing lift tickets ahead of time online. If you know you'll be going on multiple ski trips, you may want to invest in a pass that's valid at multiple resorts, like an Epic Pass <sup>(R) </sup> or IKON pass. You can easily save 50% or more on tickets by planning ahead.
  <strong><li>Meals and Snacks</li></strong> Skiing is great exercise and it's important to refuel. We save a lot of money (and time!) by packing easy-to-eat granola bars, nuts, and crackers in our pockets for snacks on the go. You can also bring a small backpack to bring water bottles. Refill your water bottle at the ski lodge for free. If you are going to eat out, see if you can split the food with your family - the portions are often quite large! If you buy an Epic pass <sup>(R)</sup>, you may also be able to get 20% off at restaurants.
  <strong><li>Travel Logistics</li></strong> When you're traveling as a family, the costs for travel can multiply quickly. We've opted to do most of our skiing on the east coast to save money, but there are ways to make a trip out west more affordable. When we went to Park City, we stayed in a condo with friends at a place 15 minutes from the mountain. While it was a little less convenient, we paid a fraction of the cost for our lodging. At the big resorts, there are often free shuttles so you may be able to get away with not renting a car. See if you can do early bird parking, which often saves you money, but also encourages you to get on the mountain earlier and avoid the crowds.
</ol>
<p><strong>Ski Gear</strong> For our first trip, we rented our skis and helmets and made sure the kids had warm, waterproof jackets and ski pants (think moderately priced, but quality brands like L.L. Bean, LandsEnd, and Columbia). Hand and feet warmers, a cozy neck gaiter, and ski socks that are warm that aren't too thick and bulky. Long underwear is perfect as a base layer so that they stay warm.  Waterproof gloves or mittens are key. Pro tip: Buy an extra pair in case they get wet or lost. Also, a lot of local ski shops have a trade-in program so you can return your kids' previously purchased skis and/or boots the following year for a discount on the next size up.</p>
<p><strong>Have Fun!</strong> It's easy to laugh about it now, but the first time we took our kids skiing was quite the "character building" experience. That's basically code for the fact that there were tears. Try to keep your perspective, take a deep breath, and have some laughs along the way.</p>

<p>I hope these tips were helpful as you think about taking your kids skiing. I'll share ongoing tips in future posts and would love to hear from others. If you'd like to be featured in a future post, please complete the form below with your name and email.</p>

<p>1. Not only was my life busy, but I didn't feel like we had any extra money to go skiing. Looking back, I'm sure we could have made it work since there are ways to ski on a budget.</p>
